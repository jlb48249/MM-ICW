Code and data supporting the publication "Molecular machines induce intercellular calcium waves and cause muscle contraction."

These data pertain to Figure 3 in the manuscript and include analysis of raw calcium traces from cardiomyocytes with a peak finder. 
Scripts found in the "Normal Condiitons" folder can be applied across the three directories to replicate the analyses. 
The peak finder algorithm can also be adjusted for curiosity's sake to determine the number of detected "spikes" across different conditions.
